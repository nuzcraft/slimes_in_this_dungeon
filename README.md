## Postmortem
I'll try to keep this short. ðŸ˜‰  
I had an amazing experience developing this game over the last 7 days. I don't have a lot of spare time, so I worked hard to get as much planned out as possible ahead of time and it turned out so well! In the end, There are SLIMES in this DUNGEON was developed in ~16 hours, something only possible because my project plan minimized downtime. Check out the repo on github for the full Project Plan, Changelog, and code. 10/10, will participate again!

As with all projects, there are a bunch of improvements I'd like to make. Below are a few stretch goals that didn't make it in due to the time constraints:  
* Story - this could have been anything!
* Advanced AI - the current slime AI is nothing to write home about. They kill themselves on EVERYTHING.
* Improved Abilities - with a few small tweaks (aka some TLC) all the abilities could be way more interesting and balanced.
* More Levels - the game is so short!! I had 3 additional levels planned, but even then it would be too short.
* Animations - just for fun 

While developing, I started thinking about the progression, and feel like that could be improved a lot too. With more levels, it would have been cool to let the play choose between 2 or 3 possible next levels. That way, they could have some say over the next type of enemy or the next gained ability. Hindsight is 20/20!!

Regardless, I'm very happy with the result!
