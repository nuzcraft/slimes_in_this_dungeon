# There are Slimes in this Dungeon
This is the code for my 2020 7DRL attempt: There are Slimes in this Dungeon

## Design
### Title - There are Slimes in this Dungeon
#### Premise
The player is tasked with venturing down in to a dungeon filled with slimes to collect the 3 COLOR crystals. Each crystal will grant player new abilities, but will also empower the slimes of the dungeon. Collect all 3 and exit to win.
#### Requirements
The game will only be considered complete when:
* The player can move around the dungeon
* the player can fight and defeat multiple types of slimes
* the player can collect all 3 color crystals
* the color crystals grant special abilities when gathered
* the player can exit once 3 color crystals have been gathered

## Changelog
### 2020.02.04 Starting the Design
This will be my first attempt at a 7DRL and I'm terrified. I've tried a couple other game jams in the past (GM48) with little success, mostly due to a lack of time, but also due to a lack of experience. This README will comprise all the normal README garbage, but will also be my design document as I begin planning my week of development. I'm very excited! My idea for a game is _really simple_ and I think thats the best way to go for my first try. I'll be coming up with a pseudo-timeline as well as plan extra features in case things go better than expected (they won't).
